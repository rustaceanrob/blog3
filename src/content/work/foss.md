- Developed a light-weight Bitcoin node designed to run in constrained environments like smart phones. Built with `tokio`, the light-client commmunicates with Bitcoin nodes over the P2P protocol, maintains a database of peers and block data, and downloads blocks with relevant transactions.
- Implemented an encrypted peer-to-peer messaging for Rust-based Bitcoin clients, part of the `rust-bitcoin` community.
To meet community requirements, the project includes zero-dependency ChaCha20 and ChaCha20Poly1305 encryption ciphers compatible with arbitrary Rust build targets.
- Actively contributing to the Bitcoin Dev Kit project, including the core library in Rust as well as the foreign language binding efforts.
- Occasional commits to `rust-bitcoin`, pull request reviews in associated projects, and community involvement on Discord and at conferences.
- Designed and created an iOS-native, SwiftUI, Bitcoin and Lightning network wallet suitable for new and experienced users.
