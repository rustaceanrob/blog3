My first job out of college, putting my data science background to use. While at Viant, I built end-to-end deep-learning models utilizing the Keras functional API, Tensorflow immutables, and TensorFlow layers. The ML team experimented with novel LLM architectures and training methods using open-source models on HuggingFace. I refactored old and stale repositories to improve data pipeline efficiencies and to reduce time and space complexity of existing models. The data science team and I leveraged tools such as Google BigQuery, AI Platform, and Google Cloud Functions.
